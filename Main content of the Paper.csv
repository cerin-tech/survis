ali2018exploring,"Exploring Relationships between Museum Artefacts 
through Spatial Interaction","Susan Ali, Ben Bedwell, 
Boriana Koleva",2018,"Visual markers, in particular QR codes, have become 
widely adopted in museums to enable low cost interactive 
applications. However, visitors often do not engage with 
them. In this paper we explore the application of visual 
makers that can be designed to be meaningful and that can 
be created by visitors themselves. We study both the use of 
these markers as labels for portraits that link to audio 
recordings and as a mechanism for visitors to contribute 
their own reflections to the exhibition by drawing a marker 
and linking an audio comment. Our findings show visitors 
appreciated the use of the aesthetic markers and engaged 
with them at three levels – physical placement, aesthetic 
content and digital content. We suggest that these different 
levels need to be considered in the design of future visiting 
systems, which make use of such markers, to ensure they 
are mutually supporting in shaping the experience.","Museum installation, interactive map, visual markers,

ali2018deepening,"Deepening Visitor Engagement with Museum Exhibits 
through Hand-crafted Visual Markers","Susan Ali, Boriana Koleva, 
Ben Bedwell, Steve Benford ",2018,"We propose a novel approach, which involves visitors 
physically manipulating visual representations of artefacts 
and scanning with their mobile phone different groups or 
sequences of items in order to reveal digital information 
about their relationships. To explore this interaction 
mechanism we collaborated with a museum to develop an 
interactive paper map, on which visitors can place tangible 
representations of artefacts and scan the resulting 
arrangements. Based on an in-situ study of its use, we reveal 
that museum visitors engaged in different strategies for 
exploration of relationships between artefacts in the museum 
collection (inspection, strategic and experimental 
configuration), and for social collaboration (sharing the 
interaction space, adopting interaction roles and sharing a 
reaction to the “reveal”). We discuss how future interactive 
installations can accommodate these behaviours","Visual markers, mobile interaction, museums, galleries,

boboc2022augmented,"Augmented Reality in Cultural Heritage: 
An Overview of the Last Decade of Applications","Răzvan Gabriel Boboc, Elena Băutu, Florin Gîrbacia,
 Norina Popovici, Dorin-Mircea Popovici ",2022,"Augmented reality is a mature technology that uses the real world as a substrate and
extends it by overlaying computer-generated information. It has been applied to several domains. In
particular, the technology was proven to be useful for the management and preservation of Cultural
Heritage. This study provides an overview of the last decade of the use of augmented reality in
cultural heritage through a detailed review of the scientific papers in the field. We analyzed the
applications published on Scopus and Clarivate Web of Science databases over a period of 9 years
(2012–2021). Bibliometric data consisted of 1201 documents, and their analysis was performed using
various tools, including ScientoPy, VOS Viewer, and Microsoft Excel. The results revealed eight
trending topics of applying augmented reality technology to cultural heritage: 3D reconstruction of
cultural artifacts, digital heritage, virtual museums, user experience, education, tourism, intangible
cultural heritage, and gamification. Each topic is discussed in detail in the article sections, providing
insight into existing applications and research trends for each application field.","3D reconstruction, digital heritage, virtual museums, user experience, education, tourism,

jiang2022study,"A Study of Factors Influencing the Continuance Intention
 to the Usage of Augmented Reality in Museums","Qianling Jiang, Jiangjie Chen, 
Yutong Wu, Chao Gu, Jie Sun ",2020,"Augmented reality (AR) technology has rapidly developed in recent years. This technology
is widely used in various fields, including museum exhibitions, where people use it to experience
art in a new way. While AR aims to realize the interaction between the virtual world and the real
world, museums use AR to develop new digital artwork from artifacts. When text descriptions
are no longer attractive to the audience, museums need to add more sound effects to images and
video dynamics to develop a sustainable way for the industry’s future. For the continued use of
such technology and the better development of the museum industry, this study used a structural
equation model to explore the influences on the continuance intention of museum AR technology
through experiments and questionnaires. Furthermore, it established a model with six dimensions:
interaction quality, information quality, information richness, satisfaction, perceived playfulness, and
continuance intention. Moreover, the results of this study can serve as a reference for managers to
promote the extensive application of AR technology in museum construction, thereby providing
visitors with better experiences and satisfying their needs","augmented reality, museum, continuance intention, interaction quality",Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR),"To explore the factors influencing users' intention

in Cultural Heritage Studies","Juan Camilo González Vargas, Ramon Fabregat,
 Angela Carrillo-Ramos, Teodor Jové ",2020,"Cultural Heritage (CH) refers to the representation of historical places and traditional
customs of a specific city or country. Its principal aim is to transmit to future generations how their
ancestors lived, and what their customs and buildings were like, etc. Nowadays, there are different
technology systems and research investigations that are focused on CH education that use augmented
reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR). The aim of this document is to specifically
identify if the use of AR improves students’ motivation to learn about topics related to CH. To this
end, studies from different databases and specific journals, along with those concerning technology
systems, were evaluated, and comparisons were made between them. Additionally, the aspects that
should be considered in future research to improve student motivation and technology systems

king2025evaluating,"Evaluating Museum Exhibits: Quantifying Visitor Experience and Museum Impact 
with User Experience Methodologies","Ellie King, M. Paul Smith, Paul F. Wilson, 
Janet F. Stott, Mark A. Williams ",2020,"Underpinned by the Model for Museum Exhibit User 
Experience (MEUX; King et al., Visitor Studies, 2023, 
26, 59), this paper develops and presents an evaluation 
methodology for museum exhibits that utilizes existing methodologies from the user experience sector 
adapted for the museum and cultural heritage sectors. 
Two studies are presented: an in-depth evaluation of 
the Meat the Future exhibition at Oxford University 
Museum of Natural History and then a comparative 
study between this exhibition and two other permanent exhibits at the museum. Quantitative and qualitative data provide a nuanced picture of each exhibit 
from the visitor perspective and showcase the benefits 
of the MEUX methods of evaluation. Results show 
how three different exhibits are constructed in different ways, providing different visitor experiences and 
outcomes. They are directly compared with identify 
statistical differences, but do not impose a judgment 
as to whether any exhibit is better than another. With 
detailed, nuanced and rigorous data capturing visitor experiences of engaging with exhibits, the MEUX 
evaluation methodology allows for more sophisticated, 
standardized and efficient evaluation practices within 
the sector, with results that directly support further development of exhibits and exhibitions.","Museum Exhibit Evaluation,

argyriou2020design,"Design Methodology for 360° Immersive Video Applications:
 The Case Study of a Cultural Heritage Virtual Tour","Lemonia Argyriou, Daphne Economou,
 Vassiliki Bouki",2020,"Three hundred sixty–degree (360°) immersive video applications for Head Mounted Display (HMD) devices offer great potential
in providing engaging forms of experiential media solutions especially in Cultural Heritage education. Design challenges emerge
though by this new kind of immersive media due to the 2D form of resources used for their construction, the lack of depth, the
limited interaction and the need to address the sense of presence. In addition, the use of Virtual Reality (VR) headsets often causes
nausea, or motion sickness effects imposing further implications in moderate motion design tasks. This paper introduces a
methodological categorisation of tasks and techniques for the design of 360° immersive video applications. Following the design
approach presented, a testbed application has been created as an immersive interactive virtual tour at the historical centre of the
city of Rethymno in Crete, Greece, which has undergone user trials. Based on the analysis of the results of this study, a set of
design guidelines for the implementation of 360° immersive video virtual tours is proposed.","Virtual cultural heritage, Immersive video, Immersive storytelling, Design guidelines, Immersion, Experiential

increasing attention. However, the understanding of the factors infuencing tourists’ post-experience intention with augmented reality devices is incomplete and there is a lack of empirical research. This study explores 
the impact of AR technical factors, individual factors and situational factors on users’ post-experience AR usage 
intention and destination revisit intention through satisfaction based on a socio-technical perspective. The survey 
data collected from 254 visitors who visited the Liangzhu Museum using the corresponding AR glasses were analysed, and the results showed that the novelty of the technical aspect, the technology trust of the individual aspect 
and the aesthetics, education and authenticity of the situational aspect infuenced visitors’ AR usage intention 
and destination revisit intention through satisfaction. This study has an impact on future research on the application 
of augmented reality technology to heritage museums.","augmented reality, heritage museum, Socio-technical perspective",Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR),"To explore why people use

identify heritage tourists’ needs and involvement when developing mobile AR heritage applications
using a grounded theory approach. Since AR applications are still in their infancy in the tourism
industry the grounded theory approach was employed. Fifty in-depth interviews were conducted in
Macau’s World Heritage Sites. The interview transcripts were analyzed by the open coding method
with the NVivo software, the process of axial coding and the selective coding method. This study
generated new requirements for mobile AR heritage applications that reflect the needs of the Asian
tourist market, which are different from those of the European tourist market. The characteristic
of tourist empowerment and the association between co-creation and tourism were also identi-
fied. This study contributes to provide a theoretical framework for designing mobile AR heritage
applications and has implications for mobile AR application developers and tourism practitioners.","augmented reality, co-creation, tourist requirements, heritage tourism, Macau",Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR),"To explore how mobile AR applications
